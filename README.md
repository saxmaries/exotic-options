# exotic-options
This project simulates and prices various exotic options (barrier, Asian, digital, autocallables, etc.) using stochastic models (GBM, Heston) and Monte Carlo methods in Python.  
It is designed to help understand structured product behavior and explore how different model assumptions impact payoff and risk.
